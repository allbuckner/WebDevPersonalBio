        <p>
          Allen Buckner is a freshman in the Washington University class of 2022.
          He is currently pursuing a degree in <b>Computer Science</b> with a possibility
          of a <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> minor. He wishes to move towards becoming a
          software developer while leaving his options open for various areas of
          engineering as he's not 100% decided on his future profession. Allen
          enjoys learning, especially in computer related fields, so he's taking classes
          to learn as much as he can while exploring his interest in computers.
